## What's that ?
Triplan is a iOS application made during the Challenge Smart City X Epitech X Edhec in 2017.
This app is a touristic companion with which the user can:</br>
* Find a large range of activity in relation to the choice he made later during a short quiz,</br>
* Plan a trip quickly and easily,</br>
* Buy a touristic pass (all inclusive: Museums, Transports, x% off in restaurants and hotels...),</br>
* Validate activity tickets and transport tickets.</br>
</br>
During this challenge we developed a iOS application (Triplan itself), a prototype of the application for the oral presentation and a little program to show NFC technology to our interlocutors.</br>
This application was made thanks to SRAttractionsMap.
