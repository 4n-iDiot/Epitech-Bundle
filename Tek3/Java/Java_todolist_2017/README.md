## What's that ?
The goal of this project was to discover the Android development environment in Java by developing a To Do List application.
The application’s functioning is close to that of numerous, already-existing To Do List applications in the Play Store(Google Keep,Evernote,Todoist,Any.DOandmanyothers).</br>
So this app is developed in Java (Webviews and NDK Android usage prohibited), compatible with the Android SDK API 19.</br>
### The project’s basic functionalities are mandatory and set out as follows:</br>
• The display task saved in the application,</br>
• The add,consult, editing and deletion tasks,</br>
• The status of the creation of a task( todo, done, etc.),</br>
• The persistence of tasks added from one application launch to an other,</br>
### A task is defined, at the very least, by:
• a title</br>
• a content</br>
• a due date/time</br>
