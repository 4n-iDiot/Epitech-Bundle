## Java Spring ?
Spring is a base for the development of applications, mainly businesses but not necessarily. It provides many features that are sometimes redundant or that can be configured or used in several ways: this leaves the choice to the developer to use the solution that suits him best and / or that meets the needs.</br>
Spring is thus one of the most common frameworks in the Java world, it is a real platform composed of projects that cover many needs and middlewares.
